                            There is growing global interest on bio-methane as a vehicular fuel and Europe Union (EU) has stated that this as a best well-to-wheel fuel. Commercialization of bio-methane under atmospheric conditions is limited due to its requirement of higher storage capacity. Compressed bio-methane systems have been currently commercialized in Europe in order to increase its low energy density however the process requires higher capital and maintenance costs. Thus, adsorbed bio-methane is suggested as a better alternative to store methane under low pressure conditions &amp; activated carbon (AC) has shown promise as a methane adsorbent. This study is based on identifying the potential absorptivity of bio-methane into commercially available AC in Sri Lanka. The paper presents the pathway envisage in this task. Two types of commercial AC samples as granular &amp; pelletize forms have been used from supplier HAYCARB for the analysis. In this paper, characterization data from the principals is used to investigate the methane uptake potential into commercial AC. Further, the study has been continued in evaluating several developed correlations in literature on linear behaviour of micropore volume of AC to methane uptake &amp; concluded that the linear parameters of micropore volume to methane uptake would vary according to AC properties. Thus a correlation for local AC is important to be developed. Hence, an experimental setup is developed to carry out detailed studies on bio-methane adsorption on commercial AC available in Sri Lanka.

                        <p>Biomass is recently gaining popularity in industry as a promising source of renewable energy. Thermal conversion of biomass is recently gaining increased attention of researchers as a way of improving the efficiency of raw biomass fuel due to higher advantages it gives as compared to direct biomass combustion. These conversion methods are well studied using mathematical models and computer simulations based on them. The present paper focuses on developing a Pyrolysis model which will be sensitive to type of wood subjected to pyrolysis. In present approach, pyrolysis reaction is represented by a one-step global reaction. The stoichiometric coefficients of this reaction are assumed to be dependent on the type of wood species subjected to pyrolysis, thus making it possible to include the dependency on wood species to mathematical model. The stoichiometric coefficients are then determined using experimental data obtained from ultimate and proximate analysis of biomass. Computational Fluid Dynamic Simulations are then run for pyrolysis of Gliricidia, Coconut shells and Mango shells.

                        <p>The cyclic nature of biomass as a fuel, has taken its advantages over fossil fuel Biomass contributes to the largest share of the renewable energy supply of present world. For effective utilization of energy stored in biomass by combustion a good understanding of the mechanisms involved in the combustion process should be obtained. Study of the mechanisms can be done through experiments or using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method. The numerical simulation approaches related to packed bed combustion modeling retrieved from research papers, books and other publications is presented in this work. This will provide a basis for understanding the complexities in biomass combustion modeling in packed beds.

                        <p>Metal processing industry in Sri Lanka began around 3000BC. Ancient chronicles like Mahavansaya, Thupavansa and Pujavaliya proved the Sri Lanka’s history of metal industry. Archaeometallurgical surveys of Sri Lanka have revealed a non-conventional wind-driven iron smelting furnace for the first time in the world. Some of them dated back to third century BC. Replications of iron smelting process have shown the ability of those furnaces to operate and produce high carbon Steel. CFD modeling and simulation is a popular tool to further understand the fluid flow patterns within and surrounding a furnace. This paper discusses the initial steps of modeling and simulation of the total process of iron smelting in the west-facing furnaces situated in Samanalawewa area of Sri Lanka. Main focus of the paper is to analyze the cold flow at 2D and 3D steady state conditions by using the open source Open FOAM CFD software with over 9 million cells for 3D simulation in finite volume method. The results have been compared with a validated simulation on the same furnace using the commercial CFD code Fluent.

                        <p>The advantages of nanocomposites containing single silicate layers uniformly dispersed in a polymer matrix were first demonstrated by researchers at Toyota in Japan, who developed nylon-6 nanocomposites and published in 1993. Polymer-nanoclay nanocomposites have attracted the attention of many researchers thereafter due to their outstanding mechanical and barrier properties. This concept is first applied to synthesis of plastics/nanoclay nanocomposites and then expanded to preparation of rubber/nanoclay nanocomposites, since few years later. The various types of synthetic rubbers, such as silicon rubber, nitrile rubber and epoxy rubber, were used to prepare nanocomposites using different techniques, namely, melt intercalation, in situ intercalative polymerization, exfoliation-adsorption and template synthesis, etc. Natural rubber (NR) was also used to prepare nanocomposites using the same techniques but with some modifications in the last decade. Now a day’s nanocomposites are widely developed in NR latex industry to achieve required properties with minimum use of clay content. NR/nanoclay nanocomposites exhibit markedly improved properties when compared to pure NR or their traditional composites. Most notable properties are increased tensile properties, gas barrier properties and heat distortion temperature, resistance to small molecule permeation, increase in atomic oxygen resistance and retention of impact strength. Tensile strength and modulus were recorded in current research as enhanced by more than two times or even ten times. It was noticed that obtaining a fully exfoliated structure is not at the desired level. Nanoclay nanocomposites are considered as fully exfoliated when inter gallery distance is greater than 10 nm but it was not achieved in many research work. Establishment of exfoliated structures in nanocomposites prepared in industrial scale is the major challenge that NR industry faces at present. NR/nanoclay nanocomposites produced with existing techniques develop high property fluctuations. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a technique to minimize property fluctuations and to obtain a reliable NR based product. It is predicted by this review that co-coagulation technique is the most promising and potential technique to fulfill the requirements of developing a NR/nanoclay nanocomposite. Use of modified nanoclays like Organoclays will aid to obtain a reliable NR based product.

                        <p>Magnesium plays a key role in the growth of a plant by acting as the central atom of the chlorophyll molecule. This study is carried out to develop a low-cost multi-nutrient fertilizer by utilizing the bittern solution. This fertilizer is capable of fulfilling the Magnesium, Potassium and Calcium requirement of a plant effectively. A dilution series of bittern was prepared, and a series of tests was carried out to demonstrate the importance of multi-nutrient fertilizer to the growth of a plant. This fertilizer contains 1.27%, 0.31% and 0.01% of highly water soluble Magnesium, Potassium and Calcium respectively to cater the short term requirement of a plant. Developing an indigenous source of supply for fertilizer is important both for the agricultural and strategic reasons. The major drawback of conventional salt production has been overcome by using bittern to produce a multi-nutrient source for plants. It could also mitigate negative environmental impacts by successfully controlling pollutant discharge. Therefore, this novel process can be considered as a comprehensive solution towards sustainable development.

                            Power transmission between interconnected systems is a major concern in the present electrical engineering context and is of utmost importance to Electrical Engineering undergraduates. A voltage scaled power system simulator with two interconnected areas has been designed, for educational purposes, using vacuum circuit breakers, a diesel generator, a motor-generator set, transmission lines, bus bars, loads etc. Synchronization of two areas and a power controller of the tie line between the two areas have been implemented. In addition, students can learn about different interactions, such as synchronous and isochronous operation of generators with large systems. This paper finallydiscusses the possible experiences of interconnected power systems that undergraduate students could be exposed to.

                            Appliance specific load monitoring is very useful in energy management solutions that are becoming a challenging task with growing energy demand. It facilitates appliance recognition and load monitoring such that optimum resource utilization can be achieved by correct appliance scheduling. In this paper we present a study of non-intrusive load recognition using steady state appliance signatures for identifying commonly used household appliances. Current harmonics, active and reactive power components acquired from data loggers are used as appliance signature in this study. This analysis enables the capability of providing detailed information on appliances in use and consumers could benefit from customized energy management recommendations. Also, suppliers could implement smart metering technology introducing appliance level information as well. We propose algorithms for non-intrusive load recognition using combination of several methods and techniques. It was seen that a higher accuracy of identification could be achieved when a combination of techniques are used rather than using a single technique.

                            This paper proposes a nine level Cascaded H-Bridge Multi-Level Inverter, realized via Distortion Minimization PWM technology which is incorporated in an Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS), operating in the low power end. The proposed UPS is capable of supplying four typical personal computers simultaneously. Due to the increased number of switching power poles used, switching frequency per device is reduced, minimizing the switching stress per device. Thus a prolonged lifetime of the inverter can be anticipated. Moreover, the suitability of Distortion minimization PWM for this inverter design is discussed compared to Selective Harmonic Elimination PWM (SHEPWM): one of the most popular PWM methods for multi-level inverters. Furthermore, in order to incorporate the designed inverter in a UPS application such that cost, weight and size are minimized while ensuring a good transient response at the failure of the mains supply, a novel approach named “Offline Synchronization”: an attempt to combine the advantages of both offline UPSs and Online UPSs is introduced.

                            A power system test system is designed using PSCAD/EMTDC software for transient analysis, which can be specifically used for transient studies with Distributed Generators (DGs) or this system can be easily developed as a Microgrid test system. The model is developed based on a section of a practical power system that is Kukuleganga area of the Sri Lanka power system. This includes 132kV transmission system, Kukuleganga hydro power station, five grid substations with 33kV distribution buses and DGs. The developed model is verified through comparing the actual fault data obtained from the Ceylon Electricity Board, Sri Lanka with the results obtained from the developed PSCAD/EMTDC model. The Discrete Wavelet Transform is used to identify the degree of accuracy in verification of the model. The test results are demonstrated for both current and voltage waveforms.

                            Electrical power supply to serve critical facilities are of high importance in today’s world. Instead of building a large electric power system, an intelligent Micro Grid (MG) can be considered as a promising power supply alternative for those critical facilities. This study presents the development and controlling of a laboratory scale MG which consists of several Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) such as Solar PV, Diesel Generator, Micro Hydro model, Battery Bank with a bidirectional inverter and critical and non-critical loads. Controlling of the MG is done by using distributed autonomous control strategies and Multi Agent System Architectures. It can operate in a grid connected mode as well as autonomous mode when it is isolated. The whole system was simulated using MATLAB and the simulation results and practical results were compared when MG is operated in different scenarios. The effectiveness of this controlling method is discussed in this paper.

                            This paper presents a methodology to design hermetically sealed shell type oil immersed distribution transformers with minimum evaluated cost according to the IEC standards. Distribution transformer model and design constraints are implemented as a user friendly software using MATLAB. An objective function for total evaluated cost is optimized subjected to ten constraints according to IEC 60076 in addition to geometrical constraints. A design example on a 630kVA transformer is presented for illustration.

                            Manufacturing industry is a rapid developing area and requires new technologies and concepts to increase the profit margin through high production rate and high quality. To have a sufficient and higher production rate there should be competent fixturing systems, because fixtures perform major tasks such as locating, holding and supporting components during manufacturing processes. Due to the large variety of the components manufactured in the industry, the fixture systems differ from one another. Therefore dedicated fixtures are widely used in the industry. Aerospace and automotive industries are facing problems such as huge space allocation for large number of dedicated fixtures, long lead time for designing and fabricating and low flexibility to change the setup at the modifications of the design. These problems cause to increase the overall cost and slow down the production. A reconfigurable or modular fixture can be introduced as a single fixture for set of components. Although it reduces the number of fixtures, leads to other issues such as high knowledge and skills required to change the setup and inadaptability with robot cells and flexible manufacturing systems because of human involvements. Flexible fixtures can be used to minimize the problems associated with irregular shaped components. This paper discusses proposed solutions of an ongoing project on flexible fixturing system for handling irregular shaped components. Alternative concepts introduced in the paper are flexible and reconfigurable. Therefore they can be applied to industries such as aerospace, automotive, stamping and ship building.

                            There is a non-negligible variation in climatic conditions in different geographical locations of Sri Lanka. Testing the performance under single climatic condition will not reflect the actual performance of a refrigerator at its intended deployment. This research is aimed at studying the performance of a domestic refrigerator unit under simulated climatic conditions representing different climate zones in Sri Lanka with respect to its dry bulb temperature. Experiments were conducted under controlled environmental conditions to emulate the climatic conditions of different climatic zones in Sri Lanka. Average hourly power consumption under each climatic condition was calculated from the results. Projected annual energy consumption and performance of the overall refrigeration cycle were also estimated. Results indicated a 5.6% increase of energy consumption per 1̊C increase of ambient temperature. Annual power consumption shows 54.2% variation within the evaluated locations. A simulation model was developed to perform the evaluation. Existing mathematical model was adopted to calculate the performance of the refrigeration cycle.

                            A hybrid photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) system is having the capability to convert solar energy to both electricity and thermal energy simultaneously and these systems can use to accomplish the energy demand of buildings. Performance analysis of such systems becomes essential to design PV/T systems matching with the operating conditions. It is essential to extend the energy flow analysis used in this regard considering economic limitations especially for urban applications. In this study a practical method to accomplish the energy demand of a building from a PV/T system is proposed and evaluated through a thermo-economic model. The performance of the PV/T collector is analyzed under different operating conditions in Sri Lanka. The responses of energy storage and local grid according to demand variations of the building are evaluated considering the economic aspects. Life cycle cost of the PV/T system is computed to assess the economic viability of harnessing energy from solar energy. Furthermore, the capability of deploying PVT technique and the potential to harvest solar energy in Sri Lanka is evaluated through conducting case studies for different locations.

                            Biogas production through anaerobic digestion is widely used to convert domestic and industrial waste into energy. In order to successfully adapt this technology for Sri Lankan domestic usage, it is necessary to identify the necessary operating conditions for optimum biogas generation. This study focused on analysing the effect of co-digestion ratios and organic loading rates on processing local domestic waste. Experiments were conducted on a laboratory scale plug flow anaerobic digester setup. The best methane yield was obtained with a co-digestion ratio of garden to kitchen waste of 70:30, at an Organic Loading Rate of 3.1 kg VS/day/m3biogas was evaluated in comparison to the average demand of households in the country, to establish the viability of biogas substitute to conventional energy sources. Future work is needed to validate the experimental results through mathematical modelling.

                            Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) based multi axis accelerometers are embedded in many modern technological applications. These sensors are widely used in smart electronics, bio-medical uses, automobiles and aeronautics. The work followed herewith is focused on designing of a 2 degree of freedom (D.O.F) MEMS based capacitive accelerometer which can be used with such vibration detection modules. The 2mm x 2mm x 100μm sensor has a working range of up to ±16g and a failure limit of 20g the movement of a proof mass which is 74.5% of the sensor area is used to generate amplified voltage signals based on the theory of capacitance using a series of capacitive comb elements mounted on the perimeter of the sensor. Process simplification is achieved with the use of a single Silicon-on-Insulation (SOI) wafer and minimum masking material. The paper contains details on structural and motion analysis performed on the design and also contains techniques which can be used for the fabrication of the sensor and electrical contacts needed for the successful implementation of the sensor into electrical circuitry.

                            Fiber optic communication technology is an essential component in any Electrical Engineering curriculum. Unfortunately the expensive fiber optic communication equipment is a major drawback in teaching fiber optics theories and principles especially in the 3rd world countries. This paper presents a development of a low cost Fiber optic power meter and a bandwidth analyzer to be used in laboratories as a teaching aid. Both power meter and analyzer are designed to operate at 850nm, 1310nm and 1550nm optical wavelengths. Analyzer measures the bandwidth of a modulated optical signal up to 500 MHz. The logarithmic amplifier enhances the power meter dynamic range. The cost of the product is less than 100 US dollars at small scale production and can be further reduced if mass produced.

                            Modern communication networks uses optical fibre extensively. The transport networks are upgrading its capacity continuously to provide the bandwidth requirement of the customer requirements. To provide such an increase in bandwidth, the transmission networks are moving from Amplitude Shift Keying modulation methods to Phase Shift Keying methods. In phase shift keying systems, data reception and regeneration required phase synchronization. This requires original optical carrier phase information. In this paper, we report a model for optical carrier recovery for optical synchronization of a Binary Phase Shift Keying input by exploiting Four Wave Mixing in Highly Non-Linear Fibers. The noise influence from the signal laser for the recovered carrier was analyzed.

                            In this review paper, recent advancements in multidimensional (MD) spatio-temporal signal processing for highly directional radio frequency (RF) antenna array based receivers are discussed. MD network-resonant beam forming filters having infinite impulse response (IIR) and recursive spatiotemporal signal flow graphs are reviewed. The concept of MD network resonant pre filtering is described as a modification to existing phased/timed array beam forming back-ends to achieve improved side-lobe performance in the array pattern, leading to better interference rejection capabilities. Both digital and analog signal processing models are described in terms of their system transfer functions and signal flow graphs. Example MD frequency response and RF antenna array pattern simulations are presented.

                            The two-dimensional (2-D) discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is widely used in digital signal processing (DSP) and computing applications. Fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) are widely used as low-complexity algorithms for the computation of the DFT as it reduces the required computation operations from O(N2) to O(N log2 N). The multiplicative complexity is used as a benchmark in comparing different algorithms as it affects the circuit complexity, chip area and power. This paper introduces a new class of multiplierless hardware algorithm consisting only of arithmetic adder circuits that closely approximates the 2-D version of the 8-point DFT. The paper discusses the theory behind the proposed new algorithm, with the DFT presented in the form of an 8 × 8 matrix. Furthermore it provide a multi-beam RF aperture application example where the 2-D DFT approximation has been used to closely obtain the antenna array patterns.

                            A directional sensing algorithm is proposed employin doppler radar and low-complexity 2-D IIR spatially bandpass filters. The speed of the scatterer is determined by the frequency shift of the received signal following down-conversion. The downconversion is done by mixing it with the instantaneous transmitted signal. The direction of the scatterer is determined by the means of 2-D plane-wave spectral characteristics, using 2-D IIR beam filters. The proposed architecture was simulated for three scatterers at 10,o 30,o 60o from array broadside, traveling at speeds of 31 ms,−1 18 ms−1 and 27 ms−1, respectively. A doppler radar module was used to transmit and receive reflected signals, that has a carrier frequency of 2.4 GHz. Simulations show both direction and doppler information being enhanced.

                            The paper presents the results of a detailed two dimensional model investigation of a rubble mound breakwater armoured with Hollow Block (HOBO) concrete armour units, with respect to the hydraulic performance. The results of the model investigations are analysed to obtain graphical and numerical relationships between the energy dissipation, wave reflection, energy transmission, wave steepness, wave period, Iribarren number and the section properties of the breakwater.

                            Coastal flooding due to tropical cyclone generated storm surges has caused considerable damage and loss of life in the North Indian Ocean region including in Sri Lanka. This paper is concerned with a deterministic analysis of the storm surge hazard for the city of Chilaw on the west coast of Sri Lanka, as a pilot study. The present hazard assessment utilizes a database of historical events of tropical cyclones in the North Indian Ocean region. A statistical analysis of the past events has been carried out to identify an appropriate storm surge scenario. Numerical models comprising a parametric cyclone model and a hydrodynamic model based on shallow water equations have been employed to simulate cyclone wind velocity and pressure fields as well as coastal inundation due to the storm surges. The spatial distribution of the depth of inundation as well as maps of the hazard to population and residential buildings in the study area are presented and discussed.

                            The Piano Key (PK) spillway constructed at Giritalein 2013, is the first of its kind in Sri Lanka. A capacity enhancement of the Giritale reservoir was required to overcome the frequent water shortages during cropping seasons and droughts. A decision was taken to enhance the capacity by increasing the crest level of the spillway and a new spillway of the PK type was introduced to satisfy this requirement. In this research, a model study was done to improve the discharge efficiency of such a PK spillway. Two models with different sectional arrangements were fabricated and later these were modified basically in crest shape. A total of four different models were tested to simulate the flow behavior over the spillway and the results were analyzed in order to find the head discharge relationship. The research focused on how to obtain a suitable PK model, among the models tested. The conclusion was that model 1b (among the models 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b) was the optimum model for the Giritale project.

                            Water diversion mechanisms are commonly used in the irrigation systems and this concept is older than tank (reservoir) systems in Sri Lanka. At present, for water diversions in the wet zone anicuts are constructed by using lifting type gates. Anicuts are used to maintain required water level in the upstream by releasing only the excess water to downstream. In the lifting gate, water is allowed to flow from the bottom and this causes high erosion in the canal. The thrust force due to water pressure on the lifting gate makes it difficult to operate the system and then controlling the system is a complex task. This paper describes the construction and operation of newly introduced flap gates and issues related to lifting gate which are presently used for diversion process. In this analysis, conceptual design of a flap gate with compressive arc type wall plate is proposed to minimize use of construction materials. In the proposed system, height of the anicut could be changed from the top and then the water level in the upstream is not varied much when compared with lifting gates for varying flows in the cannel. According to the practical experiences from implemented proposed systems, controlling of the system is much easier compared to the conventional system.

                            Experimental investigations on nailed built up timber box beams of different cross sectional profiles in which the flanges and webs are both entirely of timber are carried out with the objective of understanding the behaviour of the different nailed built up beam configurations and identify their potential as an alternative to the use of solid timber beams. In particular the effect of web thickness, overall depth and shape of flange on the load carrying capacity and flexural rigidity of timber box beams are investigated. Timber beams consisting of webs of 25 mm thickness and overall depth of 225 mm are the most cost effective. The profile of the flange does not have a significant effect on either the load carrying capacity or flexural rigidity. It is observed that flexural rigidity and load capacity are better correlated with the second moment of area and section modulus of only the webs of the box beam rather than that of the entire box beam.

                            This research addresses the problem of relative localization within a robot network possessing relative measurements between robots. The problem of correspondence is inherent to most multi-robot relative sensing methods, such as LiDAR, RADAR and vision based solutions. Multi-sensor multi-target tracking approaches addresse the problem of correspondence, when good prioris for initial poses of the sensing platforms are assumed. However the multi-robot relative localization problem differs from the classical multi-target tracking scenario due to; a) the unavailability of initial poses of sensing platforms, b) the existence of mutual measurements between the sensing platforms, and c) the measurement set being mixed with both known and unknown correspondences. To address these specific characteristics of multi-robot systems, this study proposes a distributed data correspondence architecture which performs multi-hypothesis estimation of the robot states. The proposed architecture is implemented on a multi-robot relative sensor configuration which possess range measurements with known data correspondence and bearing measurements with unknown data correspondence. The proposed distributed multi-robot localization method is capable of addressing measurement correspondence, noise, and measurement clutter effectively, while possessing inherent initialization and recovery capability from unknown poses.

                            The skill preservation of an expert has been a serious problem for countries with aging population because decrease of the number of successors. The concepts of haptic database and force sensor recorder which have been developed recently suggests solutions of using third multimedia type of haptic communication. Haptic information is abilateral information of the law of action and reaction. The reaction from real world includes not only position and force information but also environmental impedance. In this paper, the behavior of environmental impedance has been studied with the changes of the different motion parameters like applied force, velocity, position and depth on the object 3D space. This idea is exemplified using a rubber balloon and a rubber sponge which is often modeled using simple linear equations. The experimental results show the importance of considering motion parameters when abstracting haptic information for a haptic database. Nonlinear impedance variations against the motion parameters suggest the necessity of adopting complex haptic abstraction techniques.

                            Pitch and airspeed responses of a medium scale UAV were identified using the prediction error method. Data collection was conducted with an active closed loop autopilot control system. A naive SISO open loop transfer function was estimated using the parametric direct approach. Since its predictability was not significant, better estimators were developed using MISO parametric direct, and SISO parametric indirect method. The model validations were done to quantify their predictability.

                            Assistive robots for elderly and disabled people are being developed to uplift the living standard of the people. The idea of realizing the dream for a robot assistant obviously depends on the availability of human-human like interactions in human-robot interactions also. Humans prefer to use voice instructions, which have uncertain information such as “very little”, “far” etc. in their daily interactions. Therefore, the ability of a robot assistant to understand the uncertain information is crucial. Therefore, our study proposes a method to interpret fuzzy linguistic information related to distance in user commands by evaluating the spatial information of the surrounding environment. Fuzzy logic based fuzzy linguistic information evaluation system (FLIES) has been introduced to interpret the fuzzy linguistic terms in user commands by analyzing possible movement restrictions in the surrounding environment. The proposed method has been implemented and tested on a Pioneer 3DX mobile robot. The experiment has been conducted in two different indoor environments and the experimental results of the system are presented.

                            In this paper, two stabilizing nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) designs, namely, final-state equality constraint stabilizing design and final-state inequality constraint stabilizing design have been applied to achieve two wheeled mobile robot’s control objectives, i.e. point stabilization and trajectory tracking. In both controllers, final-state constraints are imposed, on the online optimization step, to guarantee the closed loop stability. As shown in the literature, both stabilizing designs were addressed to be computationally intense; thus, their real-time implementation is not tractable. Nonetheless, in this work, a recently developed toolkit implementing fast NMPC routines has been used to apply the two stabilizing designs on a mobile robot research platform after developing a C++ code, coupling the toolkit and the research platform’s software. Full scale experiments implementing the two stabilizing designs are conducted and contrasted in terms of performance measures and real-time requirements.

                            Prosthesis is a device extension which is used to replace a missing body part. Amputees who lost all or part of the upper limb may use a prosthesis depending on their requirement. Externally powered prosthesis holds an importance since it is capable of imitating natural limb motions. However, the way they are controlled stand way back from the natural limb. Myoelectric control systems which uses electromyography signals holds an important role in controlling prosthesis. This paper reviews the myoelectric control systems for upper limb prosthesis. At first control methods based only on myoelectric signals are briefly reviewed. The main focus is given to review hybrid myoelectric control systems. Hybrid myoelectric control methods are categorized and each category is compared and reviewed. Finally feasibility of using vision as an added sensor was discussed with examples from literature.

                            Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) is a high quality bus based transit system which has been identified by the Ministry of Transport, Sri Lanka as an effective transport solution for urbanized areas. Demand estimation for the BRT is a key element in operational planning as it becomes a primary criterion for selection of vehicles, scheduling of services, determination of fleet size and the design stations etc. This paper illustrates a methodology derived from traffic survey data for the estimation of demand for the proposed BRT corridor from Moratuwa to Pettah on Galle Road.

                            The main problem addressed by the research is random arrival of customers to pick goods at a product distribution center. Using a Case Study approach, a methodology is developed for scheduling of customer arrivals as a solution. Initially the problem is studied in detail. A survey was carried out to study the current customer behavior of the selected product distribution center. Using the findings of the survey and the literature review, different scheduling solutions are generated. Three most viable solutions are selected and then those three solutions are evaluated in financial, operational and change management aspects to find the best solution. A simulation is also done for customer arrivals to quantify the impact of implementing the scheduling system. The findings of the research clearly indicate the feasibility and the customer service improvements derived by customer scheduling. The customer waiting times and the idling of the distribution point assets can be significantly reduced by the developed scheduling system. Customers’ perception of the waiting time can be reduced by providing waiting information of customers prior to their arrival.

                            Lean philosophy has received more emphasize during recent times due to its robust features which facilitate productive manufacturing environments in companies regardless of the type of industry. However, enormous approaches taken to implement lean manufacturing systems inside factories, have failed to achieve desired objectives. This is mainly due to the focus on individual lean attributes rather than considering their collective impact on a system. This paper suggested an approach to measure correlations among lean attributes using their degrees of implementation. These correlations will help organizations to identify lean attributes which are interrelated. The quest is how to measure the degree to which each lean attribute has been implemented within the organization. Different companies have varying levels of lean implementations. Therefore identifying the leanness requires the organization to compare itself against a proxy company who has also implemented similar lean attributes. This research suggested an approach to identify a proxy company and then evaluate the degrees of lean attribute implementations of the selected company. The fuzzy membership functions were used to calculate the degrees. These degrees were then used to figure out possible correlations among lean attributes. The research findings showed that visual feedback made available to the factory floor had triggered a positive impact on other lean attributes in most circumstances.

                            The main objective of this research is to find out the economic impact of adopting green practices to the supply chains of manufacturing companies in Sri Lanka and the competitiveness gained through it. Greening the supply chain is looked at from three perspectives in this research namely, greening the inbound function, greening the production function and greening the outbound function where the final outcome presents the correlation between each of these with the improvement of economic performance and competitiveness when it comes to the manufacturing companies of Sri Lanka. The population of the research is the ISO 14001 (Environmental Management System) certified manufacturing companies in Sri Lanka. Data was collected through a survey done involving all the 50 ISO 14001 certified manufacturing companies where environment management representatives of the firms were targeted through online questionnaires. A four point likert scale was used to obtain responses. Exploratory factor analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze data regarding the five variables. The research concludes with a statistically proven result that greening the inbound, production and outbound functions of a supply chain individually as well as collectively leads to improved economic performance while competitiveness can be improved by greening the inbound function of a supply chain.

                            The intermediary role performed by freight forwarders in exportation has become significant in fulfilling businesses’ supply chain needs in this dynamic world. Since the success of exporter’s business is at present, highly reliant on supply chain optimization, cost efficiency, profitability, consistent service and responsiveness, the decision of selecting the most beneficial freight forwarder has become crucial for exporters. In order to identify and prioritize key factors which have affected the exporter’s decision in selecting freight forwarders in Sri Lankan context, Sri Lankan export industry was stratified into 22 sectors based on commodity using stratified sampling technique. One exporter from each sector was then selected using judgmental sampling to have a sample of 22. Factors which were identified through a pilot survey, was organized under 6 main criteria. A questionnaire was basically developed as pairwise comparisons using 9-point semantic differential scale and comparisons were done within main criteria and sub criteria. After a pre-testing, interviews and e-mail questionnaire survey were conducted. Data were analyzed using Analytic Hierarchy Process to determine priority vectors of criteria. Customer service was found to be the most important main criterion for Sri Lankan exporters. It was followed by reliability and operational efficiency respectively. The criterion of the least importance was company background and reputation. While small sized exporters pay more attention to rate, reliability is the major concern among medium and large scale exporters. Irrespective of seniority of the exporter, reliability is given the prominence. Responsiveness is the most important sub criterion among Sri Lankan exporters. Consistency of judgments with respect to main criteria was verified through consistency ratio, which was less than 10%. Being more competitive, freight forwarders should come up with customized marketing strategies based on each target group’s requirements and expectations in offering services to retain existing exporters and attract new exporters.

                            Many organizations in the world tend to implement Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems to gain the full benefits of their business processes. System Application and Products (SAP) is one of most popular ERP System [18] available in the market. Most of the Sri Lankan organizations also focus on SAP implementation. Unfortunately, a large number of organizations fail to achieve their objectives due to unsuccessful implementation.

                            Web user profiling targets group users into clusters with similar interests. Web sites are attracted by many visitors and gaining insight to the patterns of access leaves lot of information. Web server access log files record every single request processed by web site visitors. Applying web usage mining techniques allow to identify interesting patterns. In this paper we have improved the similarity measure proposed by Vel´asquez et al. [1] and used it as the distance measure in an agglomerative hierarchical clustering for a data set from an online banking web site. To generate profiles, frequent item set mining is applied over the clusters. Our results show that proper visitor clustering can be achieved with the improved similarity measure.

                            Availability of records on environmental factors like noise, temperature, and precipitation is important in making critical decisions concerning public safety and wellbeing. Traditional methods involving dedicated human personnel and equipment in capturing these data have been reliable, but extremely costly and time consuming. We propose a data collecting and visualizing framework based on crowd sourcing that is readily available, extensible, and virtually incurs zero cost. The crowd-sourced data mapping engine (CDME) presents an extensible back-end web application and a noise data collecting mobile application targeting analyses on noise pollution, which poses a significant concern especially in urban areas. The mobile applications run as a service and updates the server with periodic noise data. The server accepts data updates and provides analytical functions such as graphs and heat maps.

                            Abstract—Crime analysis is one of the most important activities of the majority of the intelligent and law enforcement organizations all over the world. Generally they collect domestic and foreign crime related data (intelligence) to prevent future attacks and utilize a limited number of law enforcement resources in an optimum manner. A major challenge faced by most of the law enforcement and intelligence organizations is efficiently and accurately analyzing the growing volumes of crime related data. The vast geographical diversity and the complexity of crime patterns have made the analyzing and recording of crime data more difficult. Data mining is a powerful tool that can be used effectively for analyzing large databases and deriving important analytical results. This paper presents an intelligent crime analysis system which is designed to overcome the above mentioned problems. The proposed system is a web-based system which comprises of crime analysis techniques such as hotspot detection, crime comparison and crime pattern visualization. The proposed system consists of a rich and simplified environment that can be used effectively for processes of crime analysis.

                            Significant improvements in Information and Communication (ICT) infrastructure over the last decade put Sri Lanka among the top developing nations for ICT-led economic and social growth. While ICT has also contributed to increased research out-comes through better access to world-class knowledge, research resources, and other researchers, overall growth and significance of research findings are not in par with most of the top developing nations. In this research, through surveys and interviews, we explore the current state of computing resources available for research, as well as the needs and challenges faced by researchers. We identified a number of challenges, including shortage of computational and storage resources, cost of software licenses, limited awareness of alternative tools, inadequate programming skills among graduate students, unavailability of research computing support staff, unreliable infrastructure, and organizational constraints. We further discuss potential solutions to address some of these technical and nontechnical challenges.

                            Modern scientific experiments generate vast volumes of data which are hard to keep track of. Consequently, scientists find it difficult to reuse and share these data sets. We address this problem by developing a schema-independent data cataloging framework for efficient management of scientific data. The proposed solution consists of an agent which automatically identifies new data products and extract metadata from them, as well as a server which indexes the metadata using a NoSQL database and provides a REST API for querying, sharing, and reusing the data sets. The novelty of our solution lies in the pluggable metadata extraction logic, extensible data product generation monitors, use of a NoSQL database, and the ability to dynamically add new metadata fields. The use of Apache Solr as the backend database enables the proposed solution to index and search data products much fatser than a solution based on relational databases. For example, our Apache Solr based implementation can resolve full text, sub-string, prefix, and suffix queries 91% - 99% faster than a MySQL-based implementation.

                            Solar energy has received increasing attention as one of the potential renewable energy sources for power generation in recent past. Introduction of Net Metering and the increment in provision for renewables encouraged the usage of Solar PV systems in Sri Lanka. However, the intermittent nature of solar energy has become one of the barriers for solar energy based power to be integrated to the national power grids. Due to unpredictability solar energy based power plants are non-dispatchable and can cause network instability. With an efficient and reasonably accurate predictable model, a better system balance can be achieved. Shadowing on solar PV modules results in reduction of power produced. Cloud coverage blocking the sun can be identified as the major contributor in shadowing. Identifying and tracking the clouds can be used to finally predict the solar PV output. This paper presents a methodology to obtain cloud image data and an algorithm to process the images which can be used to predict the relationship between the cloud movements and the solar PV output.

                            Start-up marks are considered as one of the major defect in woven fabric, it occurs when the loom is restarted after loom stoppage due to various reasons. This defect is more prominent in high speed weaving looms especially with elastic warp yarns and is caused to deteriorate the fabric quality. This research paper deals with the mathematical analysis of the startup mark generation in elastic tape on narrow fabric loom. Mathematical analysis was carried out for both continuous operation condition and under stopping condition of the narrow fabric loom. A system simulation was carried out using the model developed and compared with the experimental results to show the accuracy of the model.

                            This paper investigates the possibility to use Graphene coated fabric for thermal conductive purposes. Existing methods of thermal conductivity improvement of textiles require extrusion facilities and the end products are heavy due to insertion of metal wires. By using Graphene Oxide application, these disadvantages can be eliminated. Graphene Oxide was applied onto the fabric using a simple dip and dry method and an exhaustion dyeing method. Then the coated fabric was allowed to react with an aqueous solution of reducing agents. The test results showed that the most suitable method to obtain a significant improvement in thermal conductivity of textiles is to follow an exhaustion dyeing method with reducing agents. The reduction process should be maintained at 700C for 30min duration with the addition of Sodium Hydrosulphide. Exhaust dyed fabric which was treated with reducing agents showed an improvement of 55% in thermal conductivity compared to the uncoated fabric, which is a significant improvement in the thermal conductivity of textiles. In addition to the thermal conductivity values, few related textile properties were tested to evaluate the effect of the Graphene coating on the fabric characteristics.

                            The mechanical and physical properties of tapioca based starch are known to vary in relation to physical parameters including the particle size of the starch granules. In this study, ultra sonication was used to reduce the particle size of starch solution from 100μm to 8μm and the modified starch was applied on poly cotton warp yarns. The strength, extension, moisture regain and size add-on% was tested and compared with the properties of conventionally sized yarns. The results showed that better strength and extension properties can be obtained by the application of ultra sonicated size solution at lower drying temperatures and lower squeeze roller pressures with minimum size add-on %.

                            Half way through the evolution of supply chain management, the measurement of performance became an important component to the successful implementation of its concepts and practices. The intense competition in the apparel manufacturing industry has encouraged the players to focus not only on the profitability of their businesses but also on the elements such as supplier -customer relationship management and optimization of every single echelon along the supply chain. This research presents a detailed study and an analysis carried out to determine the impact of the performance measurement systems established in apparel companies on their organizational objectives in Sri Lankan context. The apparel manufacturing companies involve in export trade that are registered under Export Development Board were considered as the population and the apparel exporting organisations which are registered under Sri Lanka Apparel Exporters’ Association were considered as the sample for this research. All the data is gathered via an online questionnaire and focus respondents are the senior level managers in these apparel manufacturing organizations. In the data analysis phase, the Cronbach’s alpha, the principal component analysis and regression analysis became extensively useful. The analysis and the conclusions are solely based on the data collected from the apparel organizations in the export industry and not having even a single representation from non-exporting small scale apparel organisations is seen as a main limitation of this study. This research brought into light that measurement of organisational performance has favourable as well as antagonistic impact on organisational performances, therefore organisations should identify the tradeoffs and set division targets accordingly.

                            The coronary cine-angiogram (CCA) is an invasive medical image modality which is used to determine the luminal obstructions or stenosis in the Coronary Arteries (CA). CCA based quantitative assessment of vascular morphology is a demanding area in medical diagnosis and segmentation of blood vessels in CCAs is one of the mandatory step in this endeavor. The accurate segmentation of CAs in Angiogram is a challenging task due to various reported reasons. In order to overcome this challenge, we proposed a region growing segmentation method which implements using morphological image processing operations and flood fill method. It can extract the boundary of main CA visualized in the processed CCA completely. This segmentation results can be further enhanced to determine the functional severity of the CA and this study laid the foundation to improving the Angiography based diagnosis technique.

                            Plant leaves provide sufficient features to distinguish them among other species. Identification of plants using leaf images is a classic problem in digital image processing. Usually those image processing systems use shape based digital morphological features for leaf identification task. Even there are number of studies on leaf based plant identification, very few of them are for mobiles. In this paper we describe a leaf image based plant identification system using SIFT features combining with Bag Of Word (BOW) model and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The system is trained to classify 20 species and obtained 96.48% accuracy level. Based on the results, we developed an Android application communicates with the server and gives users the ability to identify plant species using photographs taken of plant leaves using the smart phone.

                            When establishing object correspondence across non-overlapping cameras, the existing methods combine separate likelihoods of appearance and kinematic features in a ayesian framework, constructing a joint likelihood to compute the robability of re-detection. A drawback of these methods is not having a principled approach to reduce the search space when localizing an object in a subsequent camera once the kinematic and appearance features are extracted in the current camera. In this work we introduce a novel methodology to condition the location of an object on its appearance and time, without assuming independence between appearance and kinematic features, in contrast to existing work. We characterize the linear movement of objects in the unobserved region with an additive Gaussian noise odel. Assuming that the cameras are affine, we transform the noise model onto the image plane of subsequent cameras. We have tested our method with toy car experiments and real-orld camera setups and found that the proposed noise model acts as a prior to improving re-detection. It constrains the search space in a subsequent camera, greatly improving the computational efficiency. Our method also has the potential to distinguish between objects similar in appearance, and recover correct labels when they move across cameras.

                            With the increase of image and video data it is getting hard to store them in a single computer. As a solution the data are stored in a distributed file system. To process the data stored in the distributed file system, Google proposed a rogramming model named MapReduce. In this work an image filtering technique using MapReduce programming model is proposed. The proposed technique is possible to extend for a cascade of image filters. To verify the proposed technique for a single filter the median filter is applied on an image with salt and pepper noise. A corner detection algorithm is implemented with the use of the filter cascade.

                            Interactive robot heads are becoming more and more popular in these days and most of the tasks are replaced by robots in these days. As a solution for neck pain which has become a highly attentive illness nowadays due to use of new technological devices with wrong postures by humans, a humanoid robotic head which acts as an exercise instructor is discussed in this paper. The special features of this robot head are user identification and producing unique exercise patterns according to the user. After identifying the user, it can produce the past exercise recordings and the interactive session can be carried out by voice to voice conversation or keyboard inputs from the user. Kinematic Model and Inverse Kinematic Model are developed as discussed in this paper in order to get a more human like robot head with more human like movements. The mechanical structure is developed based on the biological data of a natural human neck. Neck mechanism and exercise instructor overall procedure with basic exercise modes are discussed in this paper. Communication with user, person identification systems, and getting visual feedback of the user movements are also described in this paper. This robot head can be further developed by adding more interactive features.

                            The major challenges associated with the transformation of a wireless system operating in air to an implantable version, antenna detuning and biocompatibility, are addressed in a coherent way. An RFID-based biomedical telemetry system designed for free-space operation was chosen as the starting reference. A new, pin-compatible, space-saving antenna with a ground plane was designed, fabricated and tested, to replace the original “free-space” antenna in the active RFID tag without making any other changes to the tag circuit, such that the tag would function well when it is placed under rat skin and fat. Biocompatibility and potential antenna detuning due to rat tissue variations were addressed in the design process, without significantly increasing the tag physical height, by applying a thin coating of biocompatible material directly over the antenna. The operation of the medical telemetry system was successfully demonstrated, with the tag placed under rat skin and fat, and its range of 60-72 cm was found to be sufficient to support medical research experiments conducted with rats in cages. Due to the biocompatible coating over the antenna, antenna matching is very insensitive to changes in tissue dielectric constants and thickness. The footprint of the new antenna is 33% less than that of the original antenna, its measured 10 dB return-loss bandwidth is 100 MHz or 11%, and overall efficiency is 0.82% at 920 MHz.

                            Nonblack particulate fillers most used with thermoplastic and rubber are calcium carbonate, silica, talc and alumina hydrates. The main characteristics, which control the effectiveness and the dispersion of filler in the polymer, are structure, surface area and chemical activity of filler. The mechanical behavior of rubber-thermoplastic blends depends greatly on interactions and compatibility that develop between the two polymers and the filler. The main objective of this study is to improve physico-mechanical properties of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) filled natural rubber (NR) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) blends using a titanate coupling agent. Two series of NR/LDPE blends, with and without titanate coupling agent, were prepared by varying LDPE loading from 10% to 90% at 10% intervals. 20 parts by weight of CaCO3 per 100 parts of combined polymer was incorporated into every blend composition. The blends were prepared using a Brabender plasticorder by melt mixing at a temperature of 1300 C, and at a rotor speed of 60 rpm. Physico-mechanical properties such as tensile properties, hardness, tear strength and morphology of the blends were studied. These properties were determined according to ISO standards. Morphology of the tensile fracture surface of blends was observed using a transmitted light microscopy. Tensile strength, tear strength and hardness of NR/LDPE blends increase with increase in LDPE loading while elongation at break decreases. NR/LDPE blends with titanate coupling agent exhibited enhanced properties at every LDPE loading. NR/LDPE blends having 30% of LDPE loading showed highest tensile strength. In this blend, NR was dispersed in LDPE matrix with good adhesion between NR and LDPE.

                            Since heavy metal pollution is a significant aspect to aquatic ecosystems, the objective of this research work was to investigate adsorption characteristics of chitosan as an alternative adsorbent material. In this study, chitosan, synthesized from locally available shrimp type “penaeus monodon” was used to observe adsorption characteristics of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) heavy metals from aqueous solution. Batch kinetic experiment studies were conducted for changing initial pH, initial concentration of metal ions, particle size and degree of deacetylation (DD) of chitosan. Simplified models such as, pseudo first order, pseudo second order and intra-particle diffusion models were used to analyze the experimental data. The result showed that the adsorption capacity strongly depends on pH and DD. It was clearly seen that higher adsorption of heavy metals occur at comparatively high pH and high DD. Equilibrium experimental data were analyzed by using two different isotherm models namely, Langmuir and Freundlich. The characteristic parameters for each isotherm and related correlation coefficients were determined by using mathematical modeling software. Isotherms show that adsorption process of Cd and Pb is a heterogeneous process.

                            Carboxylated acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (XNBR) latex was filled with surface modified precipitated silica. Surface modification of silica was affected in an aqueous medium by reacting with a synthetic polymer (SP) containing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups. The effectiveness of SP in enhancing reinforcing action of silica in XNBR latex films was evaluated through investigation of mechanical properties of vulcanized latex films cast from XNBR latex compounds filled with modified silica over a range of 5 to 20 phr loadings. Tear strength, which is an important mechanical property in certain latex based products like gloves, of modified silica filled cast films was found to be improved in comparison with that of unmodified silica filled cast films. Tear properties of cast films were continued to increase within the range of filler loadings investigated. An optimization of tensile strength was observed at 15phr filler loading in films containing modified fillers and it exceeds the tensile strength of unmodified filler added films with same loading. Morphological studies performed by scanning electron microscopy illustrated that a better distribution of modified filler particles within the XNBR matrix has occurred which may be a consequence of the discouragement of filler aggregation with surface modification. Surface modification of silica has improved the reinforcement action on XNBR.

                            This paper presents the results of a comprehensive literature survey and a web based survey on the use of Scrum in offshore software development (OSD) in Sri Lankan context. The trend in the recent software development industry is to move towards OSD. Issues and challenges related to OSD have to be solved to gain success. Scrum has gained a significant attention due to its flexible approach to managing requirement volatility and emphasis on extensive collaboration between customer and development team. However, the geographical and cultural distance of offshore teams create challenges for use Scrum with OSD. Hence objectives of the research was to identify issues and challenges related to OSD in Sri Lankan context and how those issues and challenges can be overcome by using Scrum. Results of the study reveal that key factors of Scrum such as communication, people, process, and organizational factors are having positive contribution towards OSD success in Sri Lankan context. This study further reveals the importance of combining engineering practices with Scrum to achieve the success in OSD in Sri Lankan context.

                            While software metrics typically help to assess the status of a project, process, product, and resource use, the suitability of metrics in Agile Software Development (ASD) process is frequently questioned due to the overheads involved. Moreover, many established metrics used in the Traditional Software Development (TSD) process, cannot be directly applied to ASD due to its iterative and incremental development process that is willing to incorporate changes throughout. Nevertheless, very little is explored about the use and suitability of metrics in the context of ASD. We fill this gap by exploring metrics suitable for the ASD process, use of those metrics in practice, perceived benefits, and related tools. Our survey and interview based analysis of 24 development companies identified 10 metrics that can be beneficial to the ASD process, where their benefits outweigh the overheads involved.

                            Artefact management in a software development process is a challenging problem. Often there is a wide variety of artefacts, which are maintained separately within a software development process, such as requirement specifications, architectural concerns, design specifications, source codes and test cases, which are essential to software engineering. Artefact inconsistency is a major problem since these artefacts evolve at different rates. Maintaining traceability links among these artefacts and updating those artefacts accordingly can be a solution to address artefact inconsistency. There is a need for establishing these artefact traceability links in semi-automatic way. Proper management and visualization tool is required for effective software artefact management in an incremental software development. We present a prototype tool to establish artefact traceability links and visualization of those. This paper describes the research methodology and relevant research carried out for semi-automatic traceability link establishment and visualization of software artefacts.

                            We developed a new email client which runs on the browser and is not dependent on a particular server, based on the Unhosted web application architecture. The client can connect to any standard mail server directly from the browser, using IMAP and SMTP protocols so that the user is not limited to the webmail clients provided by various email service providers. As our client runs in a browser, it is independent of the operating system. It provides a uniform user experience on any mail system. As a part of our unhosted email client, we have developed a browser extension to allow HTML5 clients to connect to IMAP and SMTP servers. Using this extension, developers may introduce new e-mail clients which are both server and operating system independent. Our client application also provides offline features so that the user can load the application and read/create mail even if he/she is not currently connected to the Internet.

                            Many computer systems; especially in corporations, contain large amount of documents such as letters, reports and presentations. Many such documents are present in several versions. Such data needs to be synchronized with branch offices and mobile devices, often over slow and expensive connections. However, as many documents are stored in an already compressed format, it is difficult to compress them further by exploiting the hidden redundancies. We present a novel approach named RepoZip which improves the compression of an existing compression algorithm over a document collection, by exploiting the inter-document meta-data and content-level redundancies. It concentrates on compressing OOXML documents that have been constructed through the archival of a hierarchy of meta-data files and PDF documents which include deflated content streams. Therefore, the RepoZip approach achieves larger compression gains over OOXML document collections or PDF document collections by exploiting usually undetected meta-data level similarities.

                            Effectiveness of eLearning has been identified as an important aspect. It determines whether the stakeholders achieve the goals of eLearning. Unlike earlier, eLearning rapidly changes with the introduction of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC). Since many students got access to experience eLearning via MOOC, perceptions of the factors leading to an effective eLearning changed according to current needs. Many users drop out of eLearning courses due to the fact that it is ineffective in many aspects. It is timely and necessary to address the needs of the users in order to achieve success in eLearning. Finding solutions to the above problem, this research used Grounded Theory (GT) methodology in finding the factors affecting an effective eLearning. We found 10 dimensions which affects a successful eLearning while actively participating in 16 eLearning courses in 5 different platforms in 2 years. This paper explains the process of GT approach which ultimately resulted in the dimensions and the explaining factors in the dimensions leading to a successful eLearning.
